## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Is this application ready for production use?

**A**: This is currently an academic project developed as part of CSE 325 coursework. While it includes core functionality for vehicle browsing and contact management, it would require additional features for production deployment, including:

- Complete user authentication and authorization
- Payment processing integration
- Enhanced security measures
- Admin dashboard for inventory management
- Order tracking and history

### Q2: Can I add my own vehicles to the inventory?

**A**: Currently, inventory management requires direct database access. To add vehicles:

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database
2. Insert records into the `inventory` and `make` tables
3. Or use the API endpoints (if you have admin authentication implemented)

Future versions will include an admin panel for easier inventory management.

### Q3: What browsers are supported?

**A**: CSE Muscle Cars works best on modern browsers:

- ‚úÖ Google Chrome (recommended)
- ‚úÖ Mozilla Firefox
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚úÖ Safari

### Q4: How do I deploy this application to a web server?

**A**: The project includes deployment documentation in `RENDER_DEPLOY.md` for deploying to Render.com. For other platforms:

1. Build the production version:

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release
```

2. Copy the contents of `bin/Release/net9.0/publish/` to your server
3. Configure your web server (IIS, Nginx, Apache) to run .NET applications
4. Set up your production database connection string

### Q5: Where are customer messages stored?

**A**: All contact form submissions are stored in the PostgreSQL database in the `contact_message` table. Staff can query this table directly or through the API to view customer inquiries.

### Q6: Can I customize the styling and branding?

**A**: Yes! All styles are located in:

- `wwwroot/css/site.css` - Main stylesheet
- Component-specific `.css` files in `Components/Layout/` and `Components/Pages/`

Images and logos are in `wwwroot/images/`. Replace these files with your own branding materials.
